# Climb On

Climb On is a web app for challenge course managers (CCM) to cut down on the tremendous amounts of paperwork they need to create and keep. The site's facilitators can complete their pre-use inspections online, seeing comments from past users, and log the number of uses each rope or cable receives. With higher levels of permissions, users can log periodic inspections, retire and replace ropes, and manage the instructions presented to the facilitators.

### Current Features
- Users can log pre-use and periodic inspections to elements, as well as input the number of uses a rope receives, and leave comments on the element
- Administrators can adjust user permission levels, allowing or disallowing access to periodic inspections and element details
- Administrators can manage the instructions provided to their staff for setup, takedown, and periodic inspections, as well as retire and replace ropes, view past inspections, and check comments made during the last week

### Future Features
- "Make it look good"
- Implement Devise and ActiveAdmin engines
- Replace omniauth-facebook with admin-created users (and allow the admin to do so in bulk via spreadsheet)
- Adding more user data, such as their ropes portfolio (maybe leading to an automatic log of hours), relevant certs, trainings, etc
- Site contact receives emails with comments from inspections
- Replies to comments, such as one a CCM would leave on a repaired piece of gear
- Gear log


## Usage
To run the app locally, clone this repo. Run `bundle install` in your terminal, run the migrations using `rake db:migrate` and you can seed the database with dummy data by running `rake db:seed`. Since it uses the gem `omniauth-facebook,` you will need to create a `.env` file and add your facebook key and secret like so:

```ruby
# /climb-on-rails/.env
FACEBOOK_KEY = (your app id here)
FACEBOOK_SECRET = (your app secret here)
```

You can then run `rails server` in your terminal, and the app will be available at localhost:3000.
